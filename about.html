                        India prides herself as the largest democracy in the world. There are three broad
                        pillars of Indian democracy: the legislatures who make laws, the executives who
                        enforce laws and the judiciary that interprets laws. The laws regulate a number
                        of activities like criminal offense, civil cases, taxation, trade, social welfare,
                        education and labor rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even when laws empower citizens in a large number of ways, a significant fraction
                        of the population is completely ignorant of their rights and privileges. As a result,
                        common people are afraid of going to police and rarely go to court to seek justice.
                        People continue to live under fear of unknown laws and a corrupt police.

                        A number of attempts have been made to bring the knowledge of law to the common
                        people. The Government of India took active efforts to present all laws along with
                        their amendments at indiacode.nic.in and all court judgments at judis.nic.in. Similar
                        efforts have been taken up by other privately owned websites.

                        While it is commendable to make law documents available to common people, it is
                        still quite difficult for common people to easily find the required information.
                        The first problem is that acts are very large and in most scenarios just a few section
                        of laws are applicable. Finding most applicable sections from hundreds of pages
                        of law documents is too daunting for common people. Secondly, laws are often vague
                        and one needs to see how they have been interpreted by the judicial courts. Currently,
                        the laws and judgments are separately maintained and to find judgments that interpret
                        certain law clauses is difficult.
                    </p>

                        In order to remove the above two structural problems, Lawpad is started. It
                    achieves them by breaking law documents into smallest possible clause and by integrating
                    law/statutes with court judgments. A tight integration of court judgments with laws
                    and with themselves allows automatic determination of the most relevant clauses
                    and court judgments. Hope Indian Kanoon helps you in your search for Indian laws
                    and their interpretations.
